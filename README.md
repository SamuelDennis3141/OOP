Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is a programming paradigm which is based on the concept of objects. These objects can contain code, known as methods, as well as data, known as attributes. 

Classes can be seen as skeletons and contain the methods and the data formatting. Objects are individual instances of these classes. As an example a human may have methods such as eat, sleep and drink (imagine a codified version) however from each person to person they may have different height and weight. In each instance we can specify the height and weight so we can distinguish between Person A, Person B, Person C etc.

## Four Pillars of Object Oriented Programming

There are four main pillars of Object Oriented Programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is all about "encapsulating" the data and methods into one block such that the inner workings of this block is dissolved from what is going on publically within the code. Encapsulation is also used in order to sort code to make it more readable for other developers.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is all about removing data from methods which it does not concern. This is used to prevent misuse and also to protect data.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is about reusing methods and data from other classes to reduce repeatability and also allows classes to be linked intuitively (to help developers understand the overall working relationships between different classes).

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows for the same operation name among different objects to behave differently. For example a method could be draw but one object draws a circle and the other draws a square.
